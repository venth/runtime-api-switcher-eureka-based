# runtime-api-switcher-eureka-based
This project is a playground to learn about capabilities of Netflix Eureka and Ribbon tandem studying
a case of switching different versions of the same service at runtime.

The scenarios will be as follows:

1. Active service in the version 1.0 responds with its version number
2. After activating service in the version 2.0, it responds with its version number
3. In case there is no service available client receives information Service unavailable
